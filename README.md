## Introduction
Stealth chess is an iterated version of the [classcic chess game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)
which played among 2 players. This is similar to that but there is a twist,
after every move the visible portion of the board changes and the player
can only choose the options which are visible to them and cannot play the
hidden options. Say it is p1's (black) turn now

p1 can see all the pieces of p2 as a normal chess game but they can only
see the "visible" pieces of their side of the board, similar happens for p2
during their chance. This invisible area keeps changes turn by turn and
sometimes it becomes kind and shows you all the pieces (but not too kind).



If you're looking to play around with the code,
or run the awesome chess TUI app then
take a look at the [`docs` directory](docs).
